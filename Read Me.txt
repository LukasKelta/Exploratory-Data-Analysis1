Some techniques and statistical functions thata can be perform with EDA tools include:

   - Clustering and dimension reduction techniques, which help create graphical 
      displays of high-dimensional data containing many variables.
      
   - Univariate visualization of each field in the raw dataset, with summary statistics.
    
   - Bivariate visualizations and summary statistics that allow you to assess 
      the relationship between each variable in the dataset and the target variable youâ€™re looking at.
    
   - Multivariate visualizations, for mapping and understanding interactions between different fields in the data.


In this Assignment, I tried to cover all the EDA steps to approach any new dataset with logial explenation.



I used five dataset: 

   Titanic dataset (taken from kaggle)
   Iris dataset (inbulit dataset from seaborn library)
   Flights dataset (inbulit dataset from seaborn library)
   Tips dataset (inbulit dataset from seaborn library)
   tested dataset (inbulit dataset from seaborn library)
